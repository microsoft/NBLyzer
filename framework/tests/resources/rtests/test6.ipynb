Introduction\n\nThis is a 5 layers Sequential Convolutional Neural Network for digits recognition trained on MNIST dataset. I choosed to build it with keras API (Tensorflow backend) which is very intuitive. Firstly, I will prepare the data (handwritten digits images) then i will focus on the CNN modeling and evaluation.\n\nI achieved 99.671% of accuracy with this CNN trained in 2h30 on a single CPU (i5 2500k). For those who have a >= 3.0 GPU capabilites (from GTX 650 - to recent GPUs), you can use tensorflow-gpu with keras. Computation will be much much faster !!!\n\n**For computational reasons, i set the number of steps (epochs) to 2, if you want to achieve 99+% of accuracy set it to 30.**\n\nThis Notebook follows three main parts:\n\n* The data preparation\n* The CNN modeling and evaluation\n* The results prediction and submission\n","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"d629ff2d2480ee46fbb7e2d37f6b5fab8052498a","_cell_guid":"79c7e3d0-c299-4dcb-8224-4455121ee9b0","trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed\n# It is defined by the kaggle/python Docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python\n# For example, here's several helpful packages to load\n\n\n\n# Input data files are available in the read-only \"../input/\" directory\n# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory\n\nimport os\nfor dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):\n    for filename in filenames:\n        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))\n\n# You can write up to 5GB to the current directory (/kaggle/working/) that gets preserved as output when you create a version using \"Save & Run All\" \n# You can also write temporary files to /kaggle/temp/, but they won't be saved outside of the current session\n\n# Import the necessary libs\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport matplotlib.image as mpimg\nimport seaborn as sns\n%matplotlib inline\n\nnp.random.seed(2)\n\nfrom sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split\nfrom sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\nimport itertools\n\nfrom keras.utils.np_utils import to_categorical # convert to one-hot-encoding\nfrom keras.models import Sequential\nfrom keras.layers import Dense, Dropout, Flatten, Conv2D, MaxPool2D, BatchNormalization\nfrom keras.optimizers import RMSprop\nfrom keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator\nfrom keras.callbacks import ReduceLROnPlateau\nfrom keras.datasets import mnist\n\nsns.set(style='white', context='notebook', palette='deep')\n","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"<a id=\"section-two\"></a>\n# 2.

It is like a set of learnable filters. I choosed to set 32 filters for the two firsts conv2D layers and 64 filters for the two last ones. Each filter transforms a part of the image (defined by the kernel size) using the kernel filter. The kernel filter matrix is applied on the whole image. Filters can be seen as a transformation of the image.\n\nThe CNN can isolate features that are useful everywhere from these transformed images (feature maps).\n\nThe second important layer in CNN is the pooling (MaxPool2D) layer. This layer simply acts as a downsampling filter. It looks at the 2 neighboring pixels and picks the maximal value. These are used to reduce computational cost, and to some extent also reduce overfitting. We have to choose the pooling size (i.e the area size pooled each time) more the pooling dimension is high, more the downsampling is important. \n\nCombining convolutional and pooling layers, CNN are able to combine local features and learn more global features of the image.\n\nDropout is a regularization method, where a proportion of nodes in the layer are randomly ignored (setting their wieghts to zero) for each training sample. This drops randomly a propotion of the network and forces the network to learn features in a distributed way. This technique also improves generalization and reduces the overfitting. \n\n'relu' is the rectifier (activation function max(0,x). The rectifier activation function is used to add non linearity to the network. \n\nThe Flatten layer is use to convert the final feature maps into a one single 1D vector. This flattening step is needed so that you can make use of fully connected layers after some convolutional/maxpool layers. It combines all the found local features of the previous convolutional layers.\n\nIn the end i used the features in two fully-connected (Dense) layers which is just artificial an neural networks (ANN) classifier.

It is the error rate between the oberved labels and the predicted ones. We use a specific form for categorical classifications (>2 classes) called the \"categorical_crossentropy\".\n\nThe most important function is the optimizer. This function will iteratively improve parameters (filters kernel values, weights and bias of neurons ...) in order to minimise the loss. \n\nI choosed RMSprop (with default values), it is a very effective optimizer. The RMSProp update adjusts the Adagrad method in a very simple way in an attempt to reduce its aggressive, monotonically decreasing learning rate.\nWe could also have used Stochastic Gradient Descent ('sgd') optimizer, but it is slower than RMSprop.\n\nThe metric function \"accuracy\" is used is to evaluate the performance our model.\nThis metric function is similar to the loss function, except that the results from the metric evaluation are not used when training the model (only for evaluation).","execution_count":null},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Define the optimizer\noptimizer = RMSprop(lr=0.001, rho=0.9, epsilon=1e-08, decay=0.0)","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"# Compile the model\nmodel.compile(optimizer = optimizer , loss = \"categorical_crossentropy\", metrics=[\"accuracy\"])","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"In order to make the optimizer converge faster and closest to the global minimum of the loss function, i used an annealing method of the learning rate (LR).\n\nThe LR is the step by which the optimizer walks through the 'loss landscape'.
